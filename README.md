# Walker-Project

<p><strong> Project WALKER is a smart walker system that can send an emergency assistance notification through the usage of ESP32 Wroom board and SIM800L connected via Wi-Fi. Project ALAN has 2 main features: emergency SOS button and GPS tracking system. The emergency SOS button feature uses the SIM800L and ESP32 Wroom board attached to two tactile buttons either sending an SMS or call to the registered recipient. On the other hand, the GPS tracking system uses a Neo-6M GPS module sending real-time coordinates of the user to the registered recipient through an SMS when the button is pressed, directing them to a Google Map link to access. Lastly, when the user presses the emergency SOS button, the system sends a message reporting that the user has pressed the button as it is notifying them for assistance.
